# Purpose

The SQA define Purpose as a `general description` of the software. 

If asked for the purpose of a program, you should simply say what it does. 

For the rest of this section we will be using an `SQA example question` to demonstrate how to use `Purpose`, `Scope` and `Boundaries`.


> General Problem
>
> "The purpose of this program is to take 20 pupil names, their prelim marks and their assignment marks from a file. 
>
> Calculate the percentage, and then find and display the name and percentage of the pupil with the highest percentage."   

For the purpose you are simply summarising what the program does, in your own words. 

==How would you describe it to someone who didn’t know what it was?==

For example, what’s the purpose of Microsoft Word, Google Classroom, or Instagram?
