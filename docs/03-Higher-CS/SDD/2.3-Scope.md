# Scope

The scope is a list of the deliverables (things you need to produce) that the project will hand over to the client and/or end-user, e.g.: 

* Design documents
  
* Completed Program
  
* Test plan
  
* Test results
  
* Evaluation report

!!! tip "Note:"

    Be careful of any specific requirements that might affect it, including the time limit if youâ€™re given one. 
    
    In general, you are going to have to hand over things like the `detailed design`, `test plan`, `test results`, and the `completed program`.

Using the `Pupil Grades` program, the scope would include: 

* Detailed design of the program 

* Test plan and completed test table 

* Working program 

* Results of testing 

* Evaluation report 

!!! warning "Important"

    You need to be careful with the word Scope. This is a different Scope to the one we use with variables. 


    Do not get them mixed up!
