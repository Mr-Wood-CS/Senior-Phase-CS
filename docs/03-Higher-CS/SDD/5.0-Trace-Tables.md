# TRACE TABLES
It’s common for you to be asked to complete a trace table in an exam. 

An example of a question is shown below with the trace table complete.

> Stephen wants to search for an item of data held in an array. 

> He writes the following algorithm.

``` pseudocode linenums="1"
SET list to [27, 16, 86, 47, 87, 99]
SET target to 47
SET found to false

FOR counter FROM 0 to 5 DO
	IF list [counter] =target THEN
        SET found to true
    ELSE
        SET found to false
    END IF
END FOR

IF found =true THEN
    SEND “Item found” TO DISPLAY
ELSE
    SEND “Not found” TO DISPLAY
END IF
```

A trace table is shown below which shows the line numbers where a variable has changed.
