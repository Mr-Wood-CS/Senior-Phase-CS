# Boundaries

Boundaries are the limits of what the program does and does not do. 

It can include assumptions you’ve made about what the program involves. 

In the example of the 20 pupil marks, we can make the following assumptions: 

* The file contains 20 pupil names, each with a prelim mark and an assignment mark.

* Unless told otherwise, assume the data is accurate, there is no reason to check it for validity.

* The top/highest mark is defined as the highest percentage.

* The requirements say it should output the name and percentage of the highest mark, it does not need to output every other pupil’s mark, just calculate them. 

!!! tip "Note:"

    That last boundary is important in relation the course assignment as people often read too much into the task.
    
    The boundaries are about stopping, and thinking what it actually says. 
    
    Does the project tell you to output each pupil’s percentage? No - it only asks you to output the one with the highest mark. 
    
    That might not be a very sensible program, but it’s all you’re being asked for - everything else is outside of the boundaries at this time.
