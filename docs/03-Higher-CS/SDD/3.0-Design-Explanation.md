# Explanation

For Higher, you rarely need to produce the design yourself, although you may be asked to make refinements.

You must be able to work with modular designs, using structure diagrams and pseudocode (flowcharts are not used at Higher), including data flow and a main algorithm/refinements where relevant. 

All of this is covered on the next few pages.
