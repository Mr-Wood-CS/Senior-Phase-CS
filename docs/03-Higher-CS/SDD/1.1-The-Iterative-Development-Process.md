# The Iterative Development Process (Waterfall Model) 

The Waterfall model is a structured, linear approach to software development. In this methodology, the stages followed include analysis, design, implementation, testing, documentation, evaluation, and maintenance. Although the process is often referred to as iterative because stages can be revisited, one of its main challenges is that these stages are followed sequentially.

As development progresses, new ideas and requirements will often emerge that were not foreseen during the initial planning stages. This leads to the need to revisit earlier phases of the project to address new issues and correct errors which slows the development process considerably. 

As a result, the Waterfall model is often criticized for being overly rigid, slow, and dependent on excessive documentation as each step strictly follows the last.
