# Functional requirements

The `Functional Requirements` are what the database needs to be able to do. 

These can be:

* What entities and attributes are needed (what tables and fields)

* What queries are needed to search/sort the data

In the youth club example, functional requirements could include:

* Needs a table to store details about leaders, including whether they have a first aid qualification

* Needs a tables for members and activities

* Needs a query to show members, sorted alphabetically by town
 
For functional requirements, always write your answer like:

> The database needs a table about …

Or

> The database needs a query to ...

This will help you to structure your answer, and makes it less likely you’ll confuse end-user and functional requirements.
