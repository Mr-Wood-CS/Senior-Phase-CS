# Primary And Foreign Keys

## Primary keys

The primary key ==is a field that uniquely identifies each record==. 

!!! example 

    * Everyone has a unique SQA candidate number.

    * Cars have a unique registration.

At National 5 you need to be able to identify the primary key from a given table.

## Foriegn Keys

When a field from one table or entity appears in another table or entity, it is called a foreign key.

The foreign key is a field that both tables have in common.

!!! example

    * MovieID is the primary key for Movie, 
    
    and 
    
    * DirectorID is the primary key for Director.

    Because DirectorID - `the primary key from Director` - also appears in the Movie table, that makes it a `foreign key`.
