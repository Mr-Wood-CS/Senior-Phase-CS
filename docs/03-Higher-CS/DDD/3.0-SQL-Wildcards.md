# SQL Wildcard Operations

## Explanation

A wildcard is used to replace one or more characters in a string. 

Wildcards are useful in situations when incomplete information is available and it would be impossible to write a `WHERE` clause using one of the existing logical operators =, <, >, ≤ or ≥. 

Wildcard characters are used with the SQL `LIKE` operator. The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to perform search operations. 

Two different wildcards can be used: 

%  (the asterisk) is used to represent zero, one or multiple characters 
-  (the question mark) is used to represent a single character 

==The following are some examples of `LIKE` used with the wildcards:==

| Example                    | Purpose                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WHERE surname LIKE `Thom%` | Used to find any values in the surname field that start with `Thom`                             | 
| WHERE surname LIKE `%son`  | Used to find any values in the surname field that end with `son`                                |
| WHERE surname LIKE `%is%`  | Used to find any values that have `is` anywhere in the surname field                            |
| WHERE surname LIKE `_h%`   | Used to find any values in the surname field that have `h` as the second character              |
| WHERE surname LIKE `m__`   | Used to find any values in the surname field that start with `m` and have at least 3 characters |
| WHERE surname LIKE `a%z`   | Used to find any values in the surname field that that start with `a` and end with `z`          |
