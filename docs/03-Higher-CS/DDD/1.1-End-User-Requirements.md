# End User Requirements

End user requirements are what the end users want to use the database for.

From this 2019 question, you could say that the end user requirements include:

* Club leaders need to be able to add new activities

* Club leaders need to know who which adults have a first aid qualification

* Club leaders need to be able to find activities members are registered for

* Club leaders need to be able to see all members listed alphabetically

Always write your answer like this:

> The club leader needs …

Or

> The shop staff need …

Or

> The school headteacher needs…
